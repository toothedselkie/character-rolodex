		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>Castel Torres-Knezevic has made a pleasant life for himself on Wakugaijima. A search-and-rescue operative on hiatus and a strangely laidback UA faculty member, he strikes a familiar figure around the island. He is an active community member and can be seen hanging out, chatting with the grandmas at the vegetable stand in the early mornings.</p>
		
		<p>What many would know about Castel is his previous stint as an experienced search and rescue ranger and educator in the Cascades Mountains. After all, it's easy to find recordings of his passionate lectures on local botany and mycology to families and schools alike. The Pacific Northwest remains near and dear to his heart and he wishes to return there someday.</p>

		<img src="https://github.com/toothedselkie/character-rolodex/blob/main/assets/Images/Castel/ILLO%20-%20Castel%20-%20ref.png?raw=true" style="width: 40%; float: left; margin-right: 1%;" />
		<p>Like a sunbathing lizard, Castel is often seen reclining in a hammock throughout campus. It can be hard to believe that he is an esteemed faculty member at UA High, but his relaxed air and easy-going nature put people at ease.</p>
		
		<p>In terms of his actual physical appearance, Castel doesn't strike a particularly heroic look. His height doesn't help matters, as he stands at an average 5'6". He's built like a filled-out long-distance runner, lean muscle and fat hand in hand. And on top of all that, he's impressively tan. Chalk it up to a lot of hours put into gardening and yardwork, as well as actual hero training and trail running to get there, and this also means that he is an active and outgoing person. Catch Castel exploring new trails in the local nature preserve and scrambling up rocks to find new vistas.</p>

		<p>His smile is often a crooked grin, accompanied by a glimmer in his eyes. Prominently enough anyhow is a set of snaggleteeth, one poking out between his lips whenever he isn't smiling. And of course, a few missing teeth, forever lost in the midnight hours amongst damp dirt and rough pavements.</p>

		<p>He has a tendency to let his hair grow wild like climbing ivy. Currently, it is long enough to reach his shoulders, and he bunches up some of it into a roughish ponytail, tying it off with a yellow ribbon (or any of the other ribbons or hair-ties in the collection!). By all means, he does spend enough time on it in the morning that it doesn't look like an absolute mess, but if Bronislav's up early enough, he'll carefully comb it. Wild, but neat, that's the point. Lately, Castel has been trying new hairstyles, but whether he'll finally settle on one for at least a few months is an uncertainty. As far as grooming goes, he does his best to look at the top of his game, though his perpetual stubble on his chin tells other stories.</p>

		<p>By ways of scars, Castel is not one to be cautious, and thus, he bears his mistakes. There are two on his face -- the left eyebrow and left side of the chin -- both from long-healed deep scratches in the course of his work as a ranger. Often, he states, with a wink, that they're the battle scars of wrestling a moose, but it couldn't be so, right? He has shallow claw marks on the back of his lower left leg, a reminder of a much more serious incident, though it's not one that he talks about much either. In fact, even as prominent as his scars are, he has a tendency to wave off questions when they do come up. His fingers, calloused from outdoor work, are criss-crossed by lightly-pigmented scars, the result of attempts at cooking, climbing, and little nicks with a knife while working in the depths of the mountains.</p>

		<p>As it goes, he also sports a pretty impressive collection of tattoos. Most of them are restricted to his upper body and he has a specific love for botanical designs. His right wrist is encircled by a black-white rendition of a sea krait, and mirroring it on his left wrist is a simple braided design of cowrie shells. His right arm has multiple tattoos as well: a bundle of holy basil and crocus flowers. On his other arm, honeysuckle vines encircle his upper arm, accompanied by a geometrically enclosed Narcissus blossom, in a style reminiscent of vaporwave. Curling around his left shoulder-blade is a nautilus shell, splattered with the colors of the ocean at dusk.</p>
