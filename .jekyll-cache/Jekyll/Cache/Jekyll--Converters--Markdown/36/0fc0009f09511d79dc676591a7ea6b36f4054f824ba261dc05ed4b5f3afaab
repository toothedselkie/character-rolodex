<p>It’s so hard to keep them in sight and in mind. You feel your attention slide right off, like water off a duck’s back.</p>

<p>Perhaps, you’re standing too close?</p>

<p>Take a few steps back.</p>

<p>Make out the faint edges of their form against the backdrop. Not too well-defined, on account of the multi-colored haze that floats around them, but far better than the undefined blob hanging in in your mind’s eye. And the first thing that strikes you is just how <em>tall</em> they are.</p>

<p>The next thing that hits home is how hard it is to maintain a grip, <em>any</em> grip, on a detail about them.</p>

<p>You can’t even properly remember their name, the letters slipping through your brain’s grooves. How are you going to remember the color of their shoelaces? Or the way their hands float in the air as they think through a complicated problem? Or the way they lean back as they try to illustrate a point?</p>

<p>The faint ocean-salted mist swirls around them, almost taunting the on-lookers’ attempts at knowing.</p>
